# Splatoon 3 Maps

A cloud function for getting the Splatoon 3 map names for the current and next Turf War maps.

The final output should be something like this:

> 🦑 Current maps: Scorch Gorge, MakoMart. Next maps: Mincemeat Metalworks, Museum d'Alfonsino 🐙

Here are some rhymes:

```rs
/// Paint is everywhere
/// Splatting it everyplace
/// I Disconnected
```

```rs
// I don't think you need that "&*", I think "&" should be ok
// And it wasnt assigned to output so it was thrown away
```
